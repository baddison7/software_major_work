every time the timer is at 14 sec and then check a few frames before if its at 15 then its in tellop and if its at 0 its the start of a match. 

note down team numbers and quali number for games and the start and end timestamp

before match both scores and times are 0
after timer is 0 but scores are up
check if certain pixels are blue/red


# screen record all
# x, y, w, h = 675, 1475, 1550, 200

# screen record just team numbers
# x, y, w, h = 675, 1550, 1550, 100

# just scores and timers
x, y, w, h = 1175, 1550, 550, 100


how to optimise
run at 500 normally, when nothing is changing run at 1000 or 2000 and when something has changed go back to 500
once a match has started skip forward at least 3 min (could do like 7)

can skip forward a required ammount of frames instead of counting down the timer changes
can also make the timer image only black and white for higher chance of a cache hit
